# simpleCRUD
A simple object-oriented C# parser and CRUD program.
This program:
 -  Pulls test result files from remote locations using SSH (Using WinSCP, documentation here: https://winscp.net/eng/docs/library)
 -  Parses them for important information
 -  Creates a SQLite databse
 -  Interfaces with this databse to perform CRUD operations

To-Do
 - improve comments and documentation which are very sparse right now
